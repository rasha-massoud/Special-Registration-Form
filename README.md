# Special Registration Form
Implementing the following tasks using HTML, CSS, and JS.
1) Design a Register Form (with 5 fields) using Flexbox. Validate this form using JS. Password should contain 8 characters minimum, one special character minimum, at least one upper case letter,  etc. An email should have also the email format: @, no dashes, a "dot" somewhere after the @. Store the entered fields in a JSON object. 
2) Prompt the user to add 10 numbers (using prompt()) and implement Merge Sort algorithm using JS. 
3) Ask the user to input a string and JS will display on the DOM if this string is palindrome or not. The function should be implemented recursively. 
4) Ask the user to input his/her year of birth and the system will display if the age is prime or not. 
5) Write a class using JS that represents a course and ask build a form that takes values from the user to construct an object of that class from it (using constructor). 
6) Ask the user to enter a string and reverse the letters in that string.The string might not contain letters. 
7) Ask the user to input a string. First, move the first set of consonants (one or more) to the end of the word. Second, add “ay” to the end of the word. For example, the word “banana” would become “ananabay.”
8) Implement some animations of your choice using JS (not CSS). 
9) Get your IP address using JS (automatically) and sum the even numbers in it. 
10) Display your current location in a <h3>. The location should be fetched automatically 
11) Alert when we scroll to a specific section in your page. 
Implement a button at the end of the page that will take me to the top of the page when clicked.
